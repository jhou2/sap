Galileo
Peter Buckley
SAP has a full stack of solutions to offer but customers think about business outcomes not solutions. To use an analogy - a customer buys the hole, not the drill. SAP sells business outcomes.

Together they help companies with their key performance indicators. Those KPIs are what gets measured and ultimately what shows performance. Join us for this alternative view on what SAP sells – from the customer's point of view.
